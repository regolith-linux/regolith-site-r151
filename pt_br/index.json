Diferentemente das versões anteriores do Regolith, as instalações de PPA e ISO resultam em diferentes configurações. A instalação do PPA favorece a coexistência com a área de trabalho Ubuntu existente, enquanto a versão ISO otimiza para menos utilização de recursos. Especificamente, a instação ISO é aproximadamente 1Gb menor e o uso de RAM na inicialização é reduzido em cerca de 200Mb em comparação à instalação PPA.\nOpção 1: Instalador Ubuntu  Baixe uma imagem ISO do Regolith R1.4  e então use uma ferramenta de instalação do sistema operacional como o USB Creator, para escrever o arquivo baixado em um dispositivo USB. Aqui estão os guias do Ubuntu para executar essa ação no Windows, Mac, e no Ubuntu. Reinicie o computador e selecione a inicialização a partir da unidade flash USB. Instale ou execute o ambiente ativo fornecendo informações quando solicitadas durante o processo de instalação. Veja esse tutorial para aprender mais sobre o processo de instalação. Quando solicitado, reinicie o computador e faça login no seu novo ambiente Regolith!  Opção 2: PPA  Veja abaixo sobre fontes PPA, e adicione a PPA escolhida ao seu sistema:   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release  Instale o pacote do Regolith desktop:   $ sudo apt install regolith-desktop  (Opcional) instale indicadores de status (padrão no Regolith 1.3)   $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-net-traffic i3xrocks-cpu-usage i3xrocks-time $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery # for laptops  Reinicie o computador, e ao logar, selecione a sessão \u0026ldquo;Regolith\u0026rdquo; no menu da engrenagem (⚙️):  A partir desse ponto, prossiga para a próxima seção, configuração para saber mais sobre as mudanças mais comuns que as pessoas gostam de fazer no Regolith.\nAtualizações Regolith 1.3 -\u0026gt; Regolith 1.4 O PPA ppa:regolith-linux/release está atualmente hospedando os pacotes da versão 1.4.1 do Regolith. Para atualizar um sistema existente para a versão 1.4.1, atualize o gerenciador de pacotes Regolith para a PPA release:\n$ apt policy | grep regolith # Algumas informações com URLs vão ser retornadas. Assumindo que http://ppa.launchpad.net/regolith-linux/release/ubuntu é no retornado: $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release $ sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-net-traffic i3xrocks-cpu-usage i3xrocks-time #considere também i3xrocks-battery i3xrocks-memory i3xrocks-weather Após executar a atualização, efetue o login novamente no seu sistema. No entanto, se você preparou o seu próprio arquivo de configuração do i3 ou a raiz do Xresources, leia abaixo a seção Atualizando com customizações.\nRegolith 1.0 - 1.2 -\u0026gt; Regolith 1.4 Para atualizar do Regolith 1.0 - 1.2, a URL do PPA deve ser alterada e, em seguida, novas versões de pacotes serão aplicadas pelo gerenciador de pacotes:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:kgilmer/regolith-stable $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release $ sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade Depois de executar essas etapas, você precisará deslogar e logar novamente.\nAtualizando com customizações Ao atualizar de uma versão major ou minor (ex.: 1.2 para 1.3), geralmente ocorre de os novos valores Xresources e outros arquivos de configuração serem atualizados. Xresource existente e arquivos de configuração como o arquivo de configuração do i3 vão precisar ser atualizados para que a atualização funcione corretamente. Se você personalizou qualquer arquivo de configuração do Regolith ou criou um arquivo Xresource independente (~/.Xresources-regolith), talvez seja necessário atualizar esses arquivos para levar em consideração os arquivos atualizados. Uma abordagem simples para fazer isso é movê-los para outro lugar, executar a atualização e reintegrar quaisquer personalizações desejadas nos novos arquivos:\n$ mkdir ~/regolith-backup $ mv ~/.Xresources-regolith ~/regolith-backup $ mv ~/.config/regolith ~/regolith-backup Depois que essas etapas forem executadas, logar novamente deve resultar em uma instância \u0026ldquo;em estoque\u0026rdquo; do Regolith. A partir daí, quaisquer mudanças desejadas para serem reintegradas podem ser feitas editando as novas versões dos arquivos de configuração do Regolith que existem no diretório /etc/regolith.\nMonificações nos arquivos /etc/regolith/... Se você pegou os atalhos e modificou manualmente os arquivos pertencentes ao root em /etc/regolith ou em outro local, a ferramenta de empacotamento pode não atualizar os arquivos, nem mencionar que arquivos obsoletos foram deixados. Mesmo removendo o pacote via apt remove ... pode não resultar em um sistema limpo. Nesse caso, use o comando purge para remover o pacote e excluir manualmente os arquivos restantes. Por exemplo, para limpar o arquivo de configuração do i3:\n$ sudo apt purge regolith-i3-gaps-config $ sudo rm -Rf /etc/regolith/i3 # certifique-se de fazer backup de quaisquer alterações importantes $ sudo apt install regolith-i3-gaps-config Resolução de problemas Blocos ausentes após a atualização O Regolith 1.4 altera a maneira com a qual blocos são instalados e configurados. Essa alteração é necessária para suportar de maneira limpa a arquitetura arm64 e simplificar a troca de componentes como o subsistema de notificação. A parte do 1.4, os blocos são instalados pelo gerenciador de pacotes. Veja esse tutorial sobre como adicionar e configurar blocos.\nAtualizando o Ubuntu A atualização do Ubuntu 18.04, 18.10, 19.04, ou 19.10 para o 20.04 requer que o PPA do Regolith seja adicionado novamente assim que a atualização do Ubuntu for concluída.\n Se a sessão padrão do Ubuntu não estiver instalada, instale-a:$ sudo apt install ubuntu-session. (Se você já estiver instalado, esse comando não causará danos.) Execute a atualização para 20.04. Após a reinicialização, efetue o login na sessão do Ubuntu, não do Regolith. Adicione o PPA do Regolith, pois o processo de instalação removeu os PPAs::$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release Atualize o Regolith para a versão mais recente:$ sudo apt upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install regolith-desktop Reinicie, e agora selecione a sessão Regolith na tela de login.  NOTA: Alguns usuários relataram que o regolith-desktop é desinstalado automaticamente durante a atualização. Se isso acontecer, simplesmente execute sudo apt install --reinstall regolith-desktop após a atualização ser concluída, para restaurar a sessão de área de trabalho do Regolith.\nReinstalação Caso o ambiente desktop do Regolith fique corrompido ou não inicializável, siga as etapas para redefini-lo. Nenhum arquivo de usuário será removido como parte deste processo:\n Logue na sessão de stock do Ubuntu. Se essa sessão não está disponível, instale-a com sudo apt install ubuntu-session. Se você não conseguir fazer o login, digite ctrl alt F2 para acessar um TTY. Após instalar o ubuntu-session, você terá a opção de selecionar o tipo de sessão Ubuntu na tela de login. Desinstale o Regolith de dentro da sessão Ubuntu:  $ sudo apt purge regolith-* $ sudo apt autoremove $ rm -Rf ~/.config/regolith/flags Verifique se nenhum pacote regolith ainda está instalado com apt list --installed | grep -i regolith. O comando não deve retornar nenhum pacote. Se isso acontecer, desinstale-os manualmente com sudo apt purge \u0026lt;package\u0026gt;. Reinstale o Regolith:  $ sudo apt install regolith-desktop Reinicie o computador e, ao fazer login, selecione a sessão \u0026ldquo;Regolith\u0026rdquo; no menu da engrenagem. Neste ponto, você pode remover ou manter o ubuntu-session.  Desinstalação do regolith-desktop Simplesmente siga essas etapas para remover o Regolith do seu sistema:\n Saia da sessão Regolith e entre na sessão padrão do Ubuntu. Abra um terminal e execute:  $ sudo apt purge regolith-desktop \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt autoremove Agora, remova o PPA:  $ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:regolith-linux/release Para restaurar suas configurações do GNOME, execute:  $ source ~/.regolith-gnome-backup Agora você pode excluir com segurança o diretório ~/.config/regolith.  Fontes PPA Existem 4 fontes para pacotes Regolith. O PPPA release é recomendado para a maioria dos usuários, mas algum outro pode ser melhor para você com base nas suas necessidades. Aqui está uma descrição de cada PPA.\n   Nome PPA URI Frescor Estabilidade Descrição     Unstable ppa:regolith-linux/unstable Muito Alto Baixa O PPA unstable é recomendado para desenvolvedores de projetos ou qualquer pessoa que esteja confortável com resolução de problemas do seu próprio sistema e não se importa com alguns problemas de tempos em tempos.   Stable ppa:regolith-linux/stable Alto Média O PPA stable é para aqueles que gostariam das últimas funcionalidades, mesmo entre lançamentos oficiais.   Release ppa:regolith-linux/release Baixo Alta O PPA release provê correção de bugs quando eles ocorrem e atualização de funcionalidades após o lançamento.   r1.3 ppa:regolith-linux/r1.3 Muito Baixo Muito Alta O r1.3 PPA está lacrado com o lançamento do 1.3 e não vai ser atualizado, exceto para correção de bugs críticos.    Suporte ARM Os pacotes Regolith são construídos para as arquiteturas i386, amd64, e arm64. Um instalador independente não está disponível para sistemas baseados em ARM, como o Raspberry Pi, no entanto, o Regolith pode ser instalado via PPA em um sistema Ubuntu existente.

For example, another look sporting the Solarized color palette and a different GTK theme and icon set is called regolith-look-solarized-dark.\nFinding Looks All look packages using this naming scheme can be found via the following command:\n$ apt search ^regolith-look- Installing a Look Looks can be installed via the apt tool or with any tool that can install Debian packages on the system, such as synaptic. For example, this command will install the Ubuntu look:\n$ sudo apt install regolith-look-ubuntu If you pay attention to the output of apt you may notice that in addition to installing the look, fonts-font-awesome will also be installed. As a feature, looks are able to depend on any resources or artifacts they require as packages. This ensures that once a look is installed, the user does not need to care about what other things that look make require to function properly. It's taken care of by the package manager.\nSwitching to a Look Once a look has been installed, a utility command called regolith-look can be used to enable it. To enable the ubuntu look installed in the previous step, try the following:\n$ regolith-look set ubuntu $ regolith-look refresh The command will mention that it created a file in your user directory. This file is an Xresource file, and it's stored in a specific path such that i3-gnome-flashback will look for it upon session start. Let's have a look at the file:\n$ cat ~/.Xresources-regolith #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/root\u0026#34; In essence, our Xresource file is simply pointing to another Xresource file. Lets look there:\n$ cat /etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/root ! -- Styles - Colors #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/color\u0026#34; ! -- Styles - Fonts #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/typeface\u0026#34; ! -- Styles - Theme #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/theme\u0026#34; ! -- Applications ! These files map values defined above into specific app settings. #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/st-term\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/i3-wm\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/i3xrocks\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/rofi\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/gnome\u0026#34; Here we can see that there are separate Xresource files that define color, typeface and theme (icon, GTK), and these are loaded and then applied to the UI components integrated by Regolith: st (terminal), i3-wm, i3xrocks, rofi, and GNOME.\nRefreshing a Look There may be times that the UI of the system and the Regolith look get out of sync. For example, if a program sets the wallpaper or icon theme externally, this will not be reflected in the Xresource settings. Regolith will only update itself upon login if it detects of Xresource changes have been made. If you wish to force Regolith to reload the UI based on the Xresource settings, run:\n$ regolith-look refresh Learning More To dig deeper, read about Styles in the following page and have a look at the regolith-styles README.\n","excerpt":"Looks provided by Regolith have the package prefix regolith-look-. For example, another look …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/customize/look/","title":"Look"},{"body":"Looks are a combination of Xresource definitions and associated resources such as wallpapers, GTK themes, and icons that as a whole provide the user with a distinctive user interface, all expressed as a collection of files. The default looks that ship with Regolith are natural starting points for creating new ones, but it's also possible to start from scratch as long as the required Xresource entries are defined. Ideally, looks are packaged as Debian packages with all required resources either provided by the look or added as a package dependency. By using the OS packaging system, required files and resources are ensured to be installed and available.\nRequired Files Starting from scratch, the only mandatory file for a Look as a single Xresource definition file. This file must specify entries for Regolith's required values, defined on this page. However, it's recommended to simply copy an existing look as a basis for customization, due to the compositional nature that Looks use.\nSuggested File Layout It is suggested that a look be installed in /etc/regolith/styles/\u0026lt;look name\u0026gt; and that the primary (or only) Xresource file is named root. Existing Regolith Looks decompose the Xresources into types of resources and any config specific to a UI component. For example the Cahuella Look provides definitions for GNOME (theme), color, and typeface and a specific theme for Rofi since it's configuration cannot be completely expressed via Xresource key/value pairs:\n$ find /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella -type f /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/theme /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/color /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/typeface /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/root /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/rofi.rasi Initialization When the Regolith session loads upon login, the initialization script looks in a few places for Xresource file definitions. The regolith-look tool provides the ability for users to change looks by creating an Xresource file that simply redirects to another file via the #include directive provided by the Xresources subsystem. In this way, a Look is enabled in Regolith by providing this link between a well-known Xresource file entry point to the files specific to the custom Look.\nPackaging The ideal user experience is to install a look via a package manager tool, and then using the regolith-look tool to set it. For example:\n$ sudo apt install regolith-look-ubuntu $ regolith-look set ubuntu $ regolith-look refresh In order to achieve this flow, all runtime dependencies (fonts, GTK themes, wallpapers, etc.) must be included in the package or defined as a Debian package dependency in a debian/control file. See the regolith-styles package for further information on Debian metadata. If you're new to Debian packaging, here is an introduction.\nTesting Once you have a Look ready for testing, copy the containing directory for your files into /etc/regolith/styles, for example for a Look called orange, you may have this file layout:\n/etc/regolith/styles/orange/theme /etc/regolith/styles/orange/color /etc/regolith/styles/orange/typeface /etc/regolith/styles/orange/root /etc/regolith/styles/orange/rofi.rasi Then run regolith-look set orange \u0026amp;\u0026amp; regolith-look refresh. The UI should be updated with your new look.\n","excerpt":"Looks are a combination of Xresource definitions and associated resources such as wallpapers, GTK …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/developer/looks/","title":"Looks"},{"body":"Regolith relies on the Xresource system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By changing Xresource values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for the clock.\nIn Regolith, Xresource values can be changed via two methods: supplying your own Xresource files, and overriding the existing Xresource values. The latter approach is strongly recommended, as it makes upgrading to newer versions of Regolith less likely to break. If you copy the Xresource tree completely, you'll need to integrate any breaking changes in future versions manually.\n Initialization When a Regolith session is started, Xresources are loaded in the following order:\n   File Optional Notes     ~/.Xresources Y Intended for non-Regolith settings   ~/.Xresources-regolith Y A global override to replace all Regolith settings   /etc/regolith/styles/root N The default Regolith Xresource file if ~/.Xresources-regolith does not exist   ~/.config/regolith/Xresources Y Applies specific overrides to Xresource defaults    It is recommended to use ~/.config/regolith/Xresources for customization as it requires the specification of no redundant settings, and is easier to maintain over time.\nDetermining what values can be changed The xrdb tool can be used to list the existing Xresource values. See here for a table of existing values in the R1.4.1 release. Example:\n$ xrdb -query ... gnome.icon.theme:\tMoka gnome.terminal.font:\tJetBrains Mono 12 gnome.terminal.scrollbar:\tnever gnome.wallpaper:\t/usr/share/backgrounds/ESP_016895_1525_desktop.jpg gnome.wm.theme:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark ... Examples Note that the commands presented below append text to a file. So, running the command more than once will result in duplicate lines in the file.\nExample - Update the UI for High DPI Screens By using the ~/.config/regolith/Xresources override file, we will only need to specify the values we wish to change. The xrdb tool can be used to determine what current values are set to.\n Create or add the following value to your ~/.config/regolith/Xresources file:  Xft.dpi: 192 Reload the Xresource configuration:  $ regolith-look refresh Open a new terminal to see the change take effect.  192 is just an example value, please adjust as needed.\nExample - Change i3 bar position $ xrdb -query | grep position i3-wm.bar.position:\tbottom $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm.bar.position:\ttop\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Change GTK Theme $ xrdb -query | grep gtk gnome.gtk.theme:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark $ echo \u0026#34;gnome.gtk.theme:\tAdwaita\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Enable System Tray $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm.bar.trayoutput:\tprimary\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Use Alt instead of Win as Super $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm-mod: Mod1\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm-alt: Mod4\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources Then Reload i3 for the change to take effect.\nExample - Launch nm-applet when i3 starts Some users prefer to use the nm-applet program to configure and manage their wireless network. i3 config file can be updated to launch any arbitrary program at start time. But, rather than copying the whole file, we can supply up to 3 programs via Xresources without having to change the i3 config file. For this to work, also make sure that the system tray is enabled (see above).\n$ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm.program.1: /usr/bin/nm-applet\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources This change requires you to log back in before the change takes effect.\nRegolith generates many of these values from a canonical set of definitions. See this readme for more details. If you find yourself updating many values, it may be more concise to create your own look instead.\n Further Reading See the reference page for configrations for more details about config files in Regolith.\n","excerpt":"Regolith relies on the Xresource system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/howto/override-xres/","title":"Override Xresources"},{"body":"Regolith is a collection of open source components that together form a general-purpose interface for using a computer, also known as a desktop environment [1]. Many of the UI components that are used to build Regolith are independent open source projects [2] that have simply been integrated, packaged, and configured for a specific workflow and visual aesthetic. Most computer desktop environments are optimized for ease-of-use and familiarity with commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple's OS X. In contrast, Regolith provides a way of interacting with a computer that is optimized for user productivity and does not attempt to mimic legacy UI paradigms for familiarity.\nThe Keyboard, the Mouse, and the Monitor Regolith places emphasis on the keyboard input device over the mouse, in relation to most other desktop environments. This is for one reason: productivity. Specifically, the amount of time it takes to press a keybinding on the keyboard is less than the amount of time it takes your hand to move from the keyboard to the mouse, execute a series of clicks to get to a desired action, and then get your hands back on the keyboard. While this time difference is small, it adds up quickly due to frequent interactions.\nBut this benefit comes with a one-time cost: learning the keybindings. In exchange for this up-front cost, the user is subsequently able to perform general computer actions faster and with less foreground thought. Additionally, by pushing more of the computer actions into the user's memory, more of the computer's visual interface can be devoted to the user's applications. Put another way, the Regolith interface devotes more bandwidth to the user's application and less to the general management of the computer. And because ultimately the productive output of the user is a result of interaction with applications, the general productivity of the user is increased. This is a subjective benefit, and may be more or less important to the user.\nTiling Windows Perhaps the most user-impacting component in Regolith is the window manager, an open source project called i3-gaps (which is a customization of i3-wm). This program organizes windows into tiles. By default, i3-gaps divides the screen into sections for each window, all of which add up to the entire screen. If only one program is presenting a window, then that window occupies the entire screen. For two windows, both get an equal portion of the screen, and so on. By using keybindings, the user can tell i3-gaps to resize, move, and otherwise organize windows in other ways. A key advantage to this approach is that the user is freed from micro managing window layouts (at the cost of having to learn the keybindings).\nLaunching Applications It is common for desktop environments to display application launchers throughout the user interface, in the form of icons and text. Folders, docks, and context menus are used to present a form of menu to the user. Despite them appearing visually different, they are have one function: to launch an application. As with keybindings, in Regolith this user interface of launching apps is refined and minimized. Desktop icons, panels, and docks are not used. Rather, the user invokes the application launcher which presents a menu of applications sorted by frequency of usage. The user may begin typing the name or function of the application they intend to load and the list is filtered accordingly. In addition, frequently used applications such as terminal and browser have specific keybindings. With this UI treatment, there is no fixed overhead on the display for the presentation of application launchers. This provides the user benefit of more screen space devoted to the user's applications.\nSystem Management Modern computers are complex machines with many observable attributes. For the day-to-day operation however, most of these can be ignored. Each user has a specific subset of system state they care about, and so there is no one perfect configuration for every user. By default Regolith provides on-screen state information on the bar for the user's workspaces, keybindings help, network and CPU utilization, notifications, and the system time. More or less items can be configured by the user as needed.\nIn addition to the transient system information provided on the bar, the system configuration can be changed by the user via the Settings application. This configuration system is part of GNOME, and provides a rich set of UI pages to configure WiFi networks, Bluetooth devices, displays, and other devices.\nConfiguration Files While most of the common tasks of system management and administration are handled by graphical interfaces such as Settings, lower-level configuration is done by editing configuration files that are installed as part of Regolith. For example, to change what information is presented on the bar, or to tweak the border width of windows, editing configuration files is required. These customizations are covered in the customization section.\nWhere next?

That is no longer the case but we still use the term. A desktop environment is generally applicable to any computer with a keyboard, display, and some type of pointing device.\n2: See the interface page for specifics about the component Regolith is composed of.\n","excerpt":"Regolith is a collection of open source components that together form a general-purpose interface …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/overview/","title":"Overview"},{"body":"There is nothing in Regolith Linux itself that collects any user data, either anonymously or otherwise.

Once launched, the application selected will open a window on the currently active workspace. If other windows are already present on this workspace, they will be resized to allow the new window to also be placed without overlapping or otherwise obstructing the existing windows.\nWindow Layout super backspace can be used to toggle between horizontal and vertical layout modes, which will apply to the next launched application. In this way, windows in a workspace can divide the screen into portions relative to the desired importance of the user. A blue border will appear on the bottom or right of the window to indicate the current layout mode.\nIn addition to toggling layout orientation, existing windows can be moved relative to their neighbors with super shift ↑ ↓ ← → (arrow keys) or VIM-style arrow keys k j h l. Or, super tab and super shift tab can be used to move back and forth between active workspaces.\nWindows can also be directly moved to other workspaces. The bar will indicate all active workspaces as well as the currently focused workspace. super shift [0-9] will cause the currently focused window to be moved to the workspace number selected.\nUsers can navigate to windows via super [0-9] but can also directly navigate to a specific window with super ctrl space.\nQuit an Application. Any application can be safely closed via super shift q. Crashed or otherwise unresponsive apps can be killed via super alt q.\n","excerpt":"As mentioned in the Getting Started section, super space causes i3 to execute Rofi to present a list …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/interface/apps/","title":"Working with Applications"},{"body":"Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size[1]. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features. Read below for more details.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.4 has changed in that it reads more configuration from Xresources. The intention of this change is to require a full copy of the i3 config file less often, by allowing users to customize the system via Xresource overrides instead of copy/edit of the i3 config file.\n For R1.4 in particular @ploum has provided many of the ideas and validation. Gratitude goes out to Regolith contributors and users @cheginit, @nalderto, @baldrailers, @ivomarino, @Josh-Letts, @LawZava, @SkyyySi, @tomster, @gdeflaux, @appelgriebsch, @farsil, and @MrKovar for their time and attention. Also thanks to all that helped to test and filed issues for bugs and feature requests!\nKnown Issues Issues and fixes are being tracked in this project.\nFeatures   Remontoire 1.3.1    Can render keybindings from i3 over socket or from any file. Can be configured to display on any screen edge. Visual updates and bug fixes. Presentation changeable via CSS.     New default look: Lascaille  A new look with a bolder, tighter typeface and a darker, higher contrast color theme become Regolith's default look in 1.4. Cahuella, and other looks continue to be available and can be installed with a few commands.   New File Search Dialog  Based on Rofi and mlocate, users can now quickly find files and launch their default editors from a global dialog.   Faster, Easier Customization  Virtually everything exportable from the i3 config can now be overridden directly with Xresources declarations, from changing the meta key to specifying the command that launches the app search dialog. Additionally, up to 3 user configured programs can be set to be loaded upon start. All of this is possible without creating a user copy of the i3 config file, but rather by overriding a specific Xresource.   i3xrocks supports conf.d style configuration  The status indicators in the bar can now be installed and configured independently. This allows for a cleaner dependency model and more efficient runtime characteristics. It also provides future flexibility for user contributed modules and status indicators. Plus, users can provide their own block descriptors in the user directory to easily override the defaults without having to change the i3 config file.   New architecture support: arm64  With testing done on a Raspberry Pi 4, Regolith now is installable via PPA when using Ubuntu on arm64 devices with the necessary hardware support.   Rewrite of Rofication  Rofication has been rewritten to require less dependencies and be more stable by Regolith contributor @farsil.   New Ubuntu release support: Focal Fossa  Regolith runs as a desktop environment in Canonical's latest release of Ubuntu: 20.04.   Time and Space Optimizations in ISO release  By switching from GDM3 to LightDM, Regolith avoids loading some unnecessary desktop components into RAM, resulting in between 200MB to 300MB savings on cold start. Additionally, the LiveCD installer is now based on the Xubuntu LiveCD which dramatically lowers the size of the installer and install image of the system[2]. Finally, with more fine-grained control of the bar status blocks, only the blocks you've installed will run.   Pluggable Desktop Notification Components  Users can now cleanly switch between desktop notification implementations such as dunst and notify-osd, in addition to Rofication without resorting to hacks.   Integrate gnome-terminal over st-term by Default  Regolith 1.4 uses gnome-terminal with a dynamically generated profile to overcome some character encoding and input devices. st is still available, simply by installing the regolith-st package.   Picom (Compton) config can be overriden by user  Users can provide their own Picom compositor config in their user directory.   i3 reload becomes Regolith reload  Refreshing the UI (look, colors, fonts, etc.) after making changes is now as easy as super shift r.   Polish, polish, polish  Just as in previous releases, many tiny fixes and enhancements were added to Regolith in version 1.4.    Fixes Have a look at the R1.4 project page for a list of bug fixes.\n1: This does **not** mean that Regolith uses XFCE4 or any other aspect of Xubuntu other than the install image.\n2: The trade-off is that users need to install more of the software they require after installation.\n","excerpt":"Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/reference/releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/","title":"1.4 Release Notes"},{"body":"Regolith R1.5 is a feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. To summarize, Regolith 1.5 ships simpler workspace management, a Rofi-based Look switcher, and numerous internal optimizations and cleanup. Read below for more details.\nKnown Issues Issues and fixes are being tracked in this project.\nFeatures   Next Free Workspace A typical part of managing workspaces in an i3-based desktop is moving to unused workspaces and then loading some applications. Before this feature, a user has to determine which unused workspace they prefer. This is done by scanning the list of existing used workspaces to determine an unused one. Now, the system can do this automatically. The super ` keybinding will move to the next free workspace. super alt ` will move the focused window into the next free workspace.   View and Change Looks via Rofi  Looks can be changed now via a Rofi dialog rather than having to configure the Xresource override via the command-line. To do this, use keybinding super alt l and then select from the dialog to load a Look.   GSettings Overrides Regolith now uses gsettings overrides to configure various GNOME settings for use with Regolith. In previous versions of Regolith, settings were written globally to the user session from within the Regolith startup code. This could cause issues if the user works in multiple desktop environments. Now, Regolith GNOME settings are defined in an override file that is only in effect while using a Regolith session. This allows switching between desktop environments without settings from Regolith impacting other environments.   New Looks   Users have contributed some new Looks to Regolith: dracula, gruvbox, and pop-os. Each of these looks presents a distinctive color palate, typeface, and GTK theme.   i3-gaps upgraded to 4.18.2 See i3-gaps release notes here.   More Refined Customizations Numerous small changes allow more granular system customization, such as specifying the temperature unit, custom Compositor settings, and a more comprehensive way of changing i3 keybindings without having to copy the entire config file.   More Desktop Environment Packages The following packages can be installed in place of regolith-desktop for specific sets of packages based on user needs: regolith-desktop-minimal, regolith-desktop-standard, regolith-desktop-mobile, and regolith-desktop-complete   New default compositor: Picom version 8 See Picom's release notes here.   Remontoire upgraded to version 1.4 Includes better multi-monitor support and other bug fixes and enhancements.   Optional integration with td-cli  Access a simple todo app via Rofi.   Documentation of development process. The Regolith development process is now better documented to enable greater transparency and inclusion.

Há duas principais formas para instalar o Regolith; através de um instalador baseado no Ubuntu e através de um Personal Package Archive (PPA). Qualquer um desses métodos resultará essencialmente na mesma experiência de usuário, embora a instalação pelo instalador do Ubuntu resulte em uma seleção de pacotes diferente da instalação do Ubuntu vanilla. Porém, adicionando e removendo pacotes específicos, um sistema Ubuntu vanilla pode ser configurado.\nPré-requisitos Instalador Ubuntu  Um computador moderno que pode inicializar a partir de uma unidade flash USB. Espaço livre em uma unidade local. O instalador permitirá gerenciar partições existentes ou instalar em um volume vazio. Conexão de internet para instalar atualizações durante e após a instalação. Um monitor com no mínimo uma resolução VGA (1024 x 768). O Regolith é otimizado para telas FHD (1920 x 1080). Uma unidade flash USB vazia com pelo menos 4 Gb de espaço de armazenamento.  PPA  Uma instalação existente do Ubuntu com direitos de administrador, versão 18.04 ou 20.04. 100Mb de espaço de armazenamento livre para instalar o ambiente de desktop Regolith. Conexão de internet para instalar atualizações durante e após a instalação.  Decidindo o método de instalação Se você já possui um sistema Ubuntu de uma versão suportada, adicionar o Regolith via PPA é o método mais rápido e menos disruptivo. O método de instalação do Ubuntu é melhor para começar do zero, instalando em uma máquina virtual, ou apenas garantindo que qualquer software não esteja em conflito com o Regolith.

Essa tecla normalmente diz \u0026ldquo;WIN\u0026rdquo; ou possui um logotipo da MS Windows. Em um Mac é a tecla Command ⌘. Daqui para frente, essa tecla será chamada simplemente de super, mas lembre-se de que você pode alterar para qualquer botão físico super é mapeado nas suas configurações, se você escolher.\nInicializadores O Regolith fornece vários inicializadores como a principal maneira de interagir com seu sistema. Cada um desses inicializadores tem uma aparência consistente, e fornece acesso a uma entidade específica. Inicializador padrão para aplicações super space, comandos super shift space, notificações super n, janelas super ctrl space, e arquivos super alt space.\nIniciar uma aplicação Após o login, você estará em uma tela em branco com a barra na parte inferior e alguns atalhos de teclado à direita. Para iniciar uma aplicação, pressione super space e um menu será apresentado com todas as aplicações instaladas no sistema. Se você começar a digitar o nome da aplicação que você deseja iniciar, a lista será filtrada para apenas nomes correspondentes. Você também pode rolar pela lista com as teclas de seta do teclado.\nNavegar para uma janela Para dar foco a uma aplicação em execução, a combinação de teclas super ctrl space pode ser usada para mostrar uma caixa de diálogo de todas as janelas em execução. Basta simplesmente selecionar a janela desejada e o sistema vai para a área de trabalho dessa janela e seta o seu foco.\nEncontrar e iniciar um arquivo Buscar por um arquivo específico no seu computador pode ser feito de várias maneiras. O Regolith fornece uma caixa de diálogo de pesquisa de arquivos com super alt space para procurar rapidamente e opcionalmente carregar um arquivo com sua aplicação padrão. Se o caminho do arquivo exceder a largura da caixa de diálogo, alt . ativará a justificação de texto. Pressionar enter em uma seleção fará com que o arquivo seja chamado com o comando xdg-open.\nTerminal O terminal é uma aplicação especial que possui sua própria combinação de teclas, super enter.\nNavegador O navegador padrão também é especial e pode ser inicializado com super shift enter.\nSair de um aplicativo super shift q vai fechar a aplicação focada. Para aplicações que se comportam mal, super alt q forçará o encerramento da aplicação focada, mas note que todos os dados não salvos provavelmente serão perdidos.\nAlternando áreas de trabalho A principal maneira de gerenciar como as aplicações ocupam a tela é pelo uso de áreas de trabalho. Uma área de trabalho é essencialmente um grupo de zero ou mais aplicações as quais apresentam janelas no mesmo monitor físico. Os usuários podem trocar áreas de trabalho para \u0026ldquo;ganhar\u0026rdquo; mais espaço para as aplicações ocuparem. Janelas podem ser movidas pelas áreas de trabalho. Áreas de trabalho podem estar vinculadas a um monitor ou serem movidas para outros conforme desejado. Para alternar áreas de trabalho, mantenha pressionada a tecla super e pressione uma das teclas numéricas. Isso irá navegar para a área de trabalho. Se existir alguma janela em uma determinada área de trabalho, ela será exibida na barra como ativa. Portanto, consultando a barra o usuário pode saber em quais áreas de trabalho estão aplicações ativas.\nÁreas de trabalho também podem ser paginadas para frente e para trás por super tab e super shift tab.\nConfigurando o sistema O app Configurações (também conhecido como gnome-control-center) é a interface principal para tarefas comuns, como alterar o papel de parede da área de trabalho, configurar a wifi e o bluetooth, configurar associações de aplicações e configurar usuários. Esse app pode ser inicializado por super c.\nLeitura adicional Mais combinações de teclas estão listadas no Remontoire, a aplicação de atalhos. Esse app é carregado automaticamente na primeira sessão, mas não em logins sucessivos. A janela pode ser alternada a qualquer momento clicando no ícone de círculo i na barra, ou pressionando super shift ?.\n","excerpt":"Embora abordemos tudo com mais detalhes em outras áreas da documentação, esta página cobre os …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/getting-started/basics/","title":"Fundamentos"},{"body":"Regolith 1.3 introduces the integration of Rofication into the environment. Previous versions relied on a built-in notification system within gnome-flashback but the UI was distracting. Rofication relies on a notification daemon and Rofi-based front end.

There is no other alert or other UI that would notify the user of the new message. If a more agressive notification UI is desired, dunst is recommended.\nManaging Notifications Next to the bell icon in the bar is the current number of notifications. To view and delete them, select super n and a menu will load. Notifications can be read and then deleted with delete and the notification window can be dismissed with escape.

See this page for more details.\n Regolith uses a number of files in /etc/regolith to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it's possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files. As such Regolith, upon login, will look for user-staged version of configuration files and load those instead of the defaults if they exist. This is recommended over editing the files in /etc/regolith directly as it gives the user more control over their configuration. This page describes how to create these files.\nDepending on what you wish to change, you may need your own copy if the i3 config file, Xresources, or both. If you're looking to change the way Regolith looks, Xresources may be all you need. If you want to update or add keybindings or swap out components, you'll most likely need to stage the i3 config file.\ni3 Config  Copy the default Regolith i3 config file into your home directory:  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith/i3 $ cp /etc/regolith/i3/config ~/.config/regolith/i3/config Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect your user-staged file and use that over the default in /etc/regolith/i3.  Verify the Change  Verify by running i3 --moreversion and noting the config file that is printed as a result. It should be the copy you just created. If not, be sure the path is correct. It must exactly be ~/.config/regolith/i3/config for Regolith to load it.  Regolith Styles  Copy the root Regolith Xresource file into your home directory:  $ cp /etc/regolith/styles/root ~/.Xresources-regolith Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect your user-staged file and use that over the default in /etc/regolith/styles.  Note that this root file is simply a reference to other styles that are broken down by the thing they are designed to style. For example, if you wish to customize the look of i3, you will need to also copy /etc/regolith/styles/i3-wm into your user directory and then update the reference to the new file in your ~/.Xresources-regolith.\n","excerpt":"Regolith 1.3.1 and above: If you only wish to override or provide new Xresource values, staging …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/howto/stage-configs/","title":"Stage Config Files"},{"body":"As stated in the repo readme, Regolith styles are a convention by which a set of files which define key/value pairs are loaded into memory and can be queried by xrdb or xrescat. Xresources employes the C preprocessor to allow for complex behaviors such as including more files, defining constants, and conditional expressions. In Regolith, only two preprocessor directives are used: #include and #define. #include statements are used to reference other files. Collections of files called looks were covered in the previous section of this guide. #define statements simply allow for a symbolic value to be replaced by a literal value, like defining a variable.\nDefines To maximize the re-use of theme information in Regolith, Xresources are divided into two categories of files: definition files and application files. The definition files make heavy use of the define directive. They essentially bind an abstract key, such as \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;terminal font\u0026rdquo; to a literal value, such as #0000FF or Source Code Pro Medium. In making changes to files, it's expected that these defines will change. The user may wish to specify a different icon set, or typeface, and would do so by modifying or creating a new definition file. Once this file is created, it needs to be referenced by a top-level Xresource file in ~/.Xresource-regolith.\nNote that when referencing other files in Xresources via the #include directive, shortcuts like $HOME and ~/ are not available. Absolute paths are required.\n Application Xresource files As mentioned previously, in /etc/regolith/styles lives a number of Xresources, including those for specific applications such as st or i3-wm. Opening these files will show a mapping of the abstract keys provided by the defines files to application specific keys. In this way, the general description of the look can be mapped to any UI component or application that can read from Xresources.\nLoading Order The i3-gnome-flashback session init script will check for the first Xresources file it finds in the following order:\n ~/.Xresources-regolith /etc/regolith/styles/root  In addition to a Regolith Xresources file, ~/.Xresources will also be loaded if it exists upon session start.\nAfter loading a root Xresource file, the session init script then merges any entries found in the ~/.config/regolith/Xresources file. This file provides a quick way of simply overriding a few values without having to copy the entire set of resource definitions.\nReloading Xresources The regolith-look command can be used to reload all Xresource entries as they are loaded upon session initialization:\n$ regolith-look refresh Alternatively, the xrdb command can be used to refresh specific Xresource files after they have changed. For example, to reload the user Xresource file run:\n$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources-regolith Verification You can test that a change has been made to your Xresources file by querying it from the command line. If a change was made to key foo.bar then the following command will return it's current value, or empty if unset:\n$ xrescat foo.bar empty ","excerpt":"As stated in the repo readme, Regolith styles are a convention by which a set of files which define …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/customize/styles/","title":"Styles"},{"body":"Configuration Files Regolith Linux is continually being updated with bug fixes and feature enhancements. Regolith's default configuration files live in /etc/regolith/. To customize these files, make copies in your user directory and make changes there. These copied files in the user directory are owned by the user and will not be modified by Regolith.\nPackage Updates Notification of upcoming updates including those that may introduce breaking changes will be announced on the Regolith Linux Announcements mailing list. Whenever possible, breaking changes will be confined to major version releases of Regolith.\nOnce a package has been published to the release PPA, Ubuntu's built-in package update facility will find the update and either directly apply it or ask the user if they wish to do so, depending on configuration.\nPackage Promotion Development of Regolith happens via updates to source code kept in git repos within the GitHub Regolith Organization. When a given feature or fix is ready for testing, it is published to the unstable PPA. After the change has been verified to work and not cause other problems, it is promoted to the stable PPA. Changes being preceived as high-risk will spend some additional time in stable.

Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.\n Features   Remontoire 1.1.1  Provides a live view of active i3 keybindings, introduces a machine-readable comment format for i3 config files, and fixes several layout and presentation bugs reported by users.   Ayu Looks  The community contributed Ayu themes have been fully integrated into Regolith with updates to package dependencies and configurations.   Rofi Polish  Numerous updates to the Rofi themes for all provided looks.   Easier Customization  Now, overriding specific Xresource values can be easily done by supplying only the overrides in ~/.config/regolith/Xresources without needing to copying and update any existing files. Additionally, any Xresource files in ~/.config/regolith/Xresources.d can be referenced without absolute path, enabling easier multi-machine configurations.   Utilize GNOME and update-alternatives for Default Apps  GNOME settings for default browser and update-alternatives for preferred terminal are now used by Regolith.

Many desktop environments integrate a compositor directly into the window manager, making it difficult to switch out or disable. In Regolith, the compositor is defined as a pluggable \u0026ldquo;extension point\u0026rdquo; in the packaging system. This means that compositors can be switched out simply by installing the packages that contain them. The underlying packaging system will ensure there are no conflicts and that all the dependencies of a given compositor are also installed.\nFinding Available Compositors The following command will list all compositors configured to work with Regolith:\napt search regolith-compositor- At least the following three compositors should be available:\n   Package Name Backend Description     regolith-compositor-compton-glx Compton The default compositor for Regolith. This compositor is modern, maintained, and handles screen tearing.   regolith-compositor-xcompmgr xcompmgr An early compositor that may offer more consistent performance if compton-glx is promblematic   regolith-compositor-none  A no-op package that does not run a Compositor. Best for absolute UI performance, at the cost of visual effects.    Installing a Compositor Due to the way that the compositor is managed by i3-wm, you must log out and back in for compositor changes to take effect. Restarting i3 is not sufficient.\n Run the following package install command to swap out the compositor. In this case we'll run xcompmgr:\n$ apt install regolith-compositor-xcompmgr Log back in and the new compositor should be loaded. You can verify by checking the process list for xcompmgr:\n$ ps aux | grep xcompmgr Overriding a Compositor Configuration Compton/Picom To provide your own Compton/Picom compositor config, copy the default or create your own and save it as ~/.config/regolith/compton/config. Upon next session it will be loaded instead of the default config /etc/regolith/compton/config.\n","excerpt":"Pay special attention to this section if you are experiencing odd visual glitches or slow graphics …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/customize/compositors/","title":"Compositors"},{"body":"Papel de parede O papel de parede pode ser modificado via Configurações, ou super c indo na tab de Plano de fundo e selecionando a imagem ou cor preferida.\nIndicadores da barra de status Indicadores de status como carga da CPU, data e hora, notificações, previsão do tempo e outras informações do sistema podem ser adicionados ou removidos pela instalação de pacotes. Por exemplo, para mostrar um indicador de status da bateria do seu laptop, simplesmente rode sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery e então atualize a sessão. Para encontrar quais indicadores estão disponíveis, rode apt search ^i3xrocks- ou busque por \u0026ldquo;i3xrocks-\u0026rdquo; na GUI do seu gerenciador de pacotes, como o Synaptic. Saiba mais sobre a configuração de indicadores de status nesse HowTo.\nLooks Cores, papel de parede, layout de janela e da barra, e outros fatores visuais são agrupados no Regolith e são chamados de \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo;. Os Looks fornecem uma maneira simples de alterar toda a aparência da área de trabalho com alguns comandos. No momento, a aparência só pode ser configurada pela linha de comando, mas existe um script que gerencia os detalhes para você. Como os indicadores da barra de status, os \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo; são empacotados, instalados e removidos como qualquer outro pacote de software. Por convenção, os pacotes de Look usam o seguinte formate de nomenclatura regolith-look-\u0026lt;nome\u0026gt;. apt ou um gerenciador de pacotes GUI pode ser usados para buscar looks disponíveis. A ferramenta regolith-look pode ser usada para mudar os looks e atualizar a sessão ativa com o look selecionado. Aqui um exemplo que muda para o look cahuella que é fornecido por padrão no Regolith 1.3:\n$ apt search ^regolith-look- ... regolith-look-cahuella/bionic,now 2.4.9 amd64 ... $ sudo apt install regolith-look-cahuella $ regolith-look set cahuella $ regolith-look refresh Combinações de teclas A alteração mais comum de combinação de teclas é a tecla super. O Regolith usa o Xresources como a fonte canônica da verdade para as configurações, que são lidas por vários componentes da interface do usuário. A tabela de teclas do Xresource aberta para configuração do usuário pode ser encontrada aqui. Para mudar a combinação padrão do super da tecla windows para alt, adicione as seguintes linhas ao arquivo ~/.config/regolith/Xresources:\ni3-wm.mod: Mod1 i3-wm.alt: Mod4 Para alterar outras combinações de teclas, é necessário criar uma cópia do usuário do arquivo de configuração do i3. Veja o tutorial de preparo de configurações para saber mais.\nNota: O GNOME também possui seu próprio conjunto de combinações de teclas. Quando a sessão do Regolith é inicializada pela primeira vez, as combinações de teclas conflitantes do GNOME são removidas das configurações do usuário. As combinações de teclas do GNOME podem ser gerenciadas em Configurações.\nQuase todo o resto Configurações ou gnome-control-panel como também é conhecido, é a ferramenta para configurar localidade, data, monitor, rede e várias outras configurações.

Once the update has been verified to resolve the problem and not cause any other bugs, it is promoted to the stable PPA for general consumption by Regolith users. See this section for more details on package promotion, and see this section to learn how to switch between PPAs.\nSwitching between PPAs When bugs are reported by users, we try to have them verify the fix before enabling the update for everyone. Switching to the unstable PPA is necessary for testing a new fix or feature before it becomes available to the general population via an automatic update. See this section for more details on package promotion.\nOfficial Regolith Contributors Those that have shown aptitude and desire to help others, fix bugs, or add features to Regolith may be invited to become an official contributor. Official contributors have more abilities with Regolith source repos and have a high level of trust and agency.\nTasks Regolith is a volunteer effort, and so there are no specific expectations regarding how much or in what way people contribute. However here are some tasks that are of great help to the project:\n Groom GitHub issues. If an issue is pending a response from a user and there is no response from the issue creator, close it. If an issue has been resolved but not closed, also close it. To learn about and contribute to the future roadmap, see here for project planning. As a young project, there are a lot of rough edges so if you want to work in fixes that's great but also if you're interested in new features that's fine too. Help with release planning. We try for a release every 3 - 4 months. Besides feature development and bug fixes, documentation and testing are needed. For new features, it is recommended to create a \u0026ldquo;request for comment\u0026rdquo; issue (example) and allow some time for user feedback. These RfCs will be advertised via the mailing list and official Twitter account.

A key difference between Regolith and other environments described as minimal is the integration of the GNOME settings backend. This provides a well-tested, consistent, and friendly way of configuring your environment and computer. To load the settings app, launch \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; from Rofi or press super c.\nSettings is a special app in Regolith in that it is launched in floating mode. This is because typically when loading settings a user is looking to make a specific change and then exit back to their work. Once loaded use the tab sections on the left of the window to select which item you wish to configure.\ni3-wm The i3 window manager is not part of GNOME and so it's configuration is not viewable or changable from the GNOME control center. Rather, the user must edit the config file and reload i3 to make changes. In Regolith, the i3 config file is at /etc/regolith/i3/config and users can supply their own copy that will override this default if placed at ~/.config/regolith/i3/config.\nMany things about Regolith can be configured in the i3 config file. It is best to read the i3 user guide to understand what and how to modify this file.\nMaintaining a user copy of the i3 config file requires more work when upgrading Regolith, as changes have to managed from the defaults into the user config to support new features in subsequent versions. If possible, it is better to rely on Xresource overrides to customize i3.\n i3bar The i3bar configuration is defined in the i3 config file listed directly above, but the i3bar has it's own configuration for status items. To change which information is displayed in the bar, the config directory is /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d. There is one file in this directory for every status item, plus 01_setup. The prefixed number defines the order in which the blocks are displayed on the bar. See here for information about customization.\nLook The look of Regolith is configured via Xresources, that live in /etc/regolith/styles/. This topic is covered in detail in the Customize section of the documentation.\nSession When Regolith is initially loaded, a script is run that configures the system and launches i3-wm. While it is not recommended to modify this script, it can provide details about how Regolith is structured and what policy it implements when loading configuration. This file is readable at /usr/bin/i3-gnome-flashback. In fact, this script could be considered the initial seed of the Regolith project and was taken from the i3-gnome-flashback project.\n","excerpt":"GNOME control center (also known as Settings).

Keybindings Dialog  To allow for a more consistent look and collapsible content for various monitor dimensions, a custom shortcut dialog was developed called Remontoire.   Pluggable Compositors  The subsystem providing visual effects, the compositor, can behave differently based on hardware and driver support. Regolith now packages 3 compositor backends: compton-glx (based on Picom), xcompmgr, and none.   i3-snapshot  In office environments it is common to switch between various display configurations (desk, meeting room...). i3-snapshot allows the user to quickly save and restore existing window layouts in a session.   New Rofi theme  Based on work by /u/InfernusZ9, the Rofi launcher is less distracting.   New notification UI based on Rofication  The previous notification UI was a hold over from more traditional desktop environments that prefer to present an on-screen dialog when a notification is received. Because user-focus is paramount, this was changed such that an indicator in the bar displays the number of unread notifications and the user decides when to view them via a keybinding or button click.   Floating Control Panel  The gnome-control-center app can have a hard time adapting to constrained tiled layouts common with i3-wm. Now when the control panel is loaded, it floats above the existing windows to allow for a quick settings change without impacting other apps.   Clickable Bar Status Actions  For convienence, the default blocks on the bar will launch configuration apps for the associated block. For example, the battery block will launch the power settings control panel, and the notification block will launch the notification viewer.   Discrete and packagable Looks  The underlying style framework used by Regolith has been revamped to allow for \"looks\": colors, themes, typeface, and other thematic state. Looks can be switched with a single command.   New bar status components  Network, keybindings, notifications, focused window, and other blocklets have been improved and added.   Build System  Build scripts were added and improved to allow for the generation of Regolith packages in an automated fashion, making it easier for others to roll their own.   Website  An entirely new website is launching with R1.3, to integrate more content and make it faster for users to find information.    Fixes  i3-gaps-wm: Fix for workspace label bug on startup. Revamping some keybindings based on user feedback. i3xrocks: numerous tweaks and fixes for status indicators. regolith-gnome-flashback: numerous fixes and policy enhancements to session management.

However efforts have been made to create as much consistency as possible by utilizing a simple session-wide key-value configuration facility known as Xresources. Interface preferences such as colors and typeface are defined in Xresource files and then read by components such as Rofi and i3-wm. For the most part, Xresources can be used for higher level changes. Lower level changes, for example swap out i3bar for polybar or drun for Rofi require the removal, installation, and configuration of other packages.\nIn addition to the content in this section, refer to the tutorials for step-by-step examples of how to customize Regolith.\n Look The highest level change in the way Regolith looks is called a \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo;. This ties together color, typeface, GTK theme and icons into a packagable unit known as a look. A few looks ship in the Regolith PPA, the default for R1.4 being called lascaille.\nStyles Regolith looks are a collection of style definitions that are bundled together as a cohesive whole. But, what if you want to mix and match from different looks or make small tweaks to an existing look? Well, the Xresource files that define the looks can be modified directly. For example, to continue to use the Cahuella look but change the default font from Source Code Pro to, say Ubuntu Mono, one would just need to modify the typeface Xresource file to specify the new font (assuming it's already installed on the system).\nCompositors A compositor is a desktop component that provides visual effects to windows. While not necessary for a desktop to function, they provide some hints to the user regarding the focused application, transitions, and other effects. The performance and behavior of compositors can vary depending on graphics hardware and driver configurations. Due to this, special attention was made such that they can be easily swapped based on the users needs.\nComponents A deeper level of customization is to change which components are loaded and used. This is an advanced topic and requires both some courage to deal with the unexpected as well as general technical knowledge and some patience.\nPackages Regolith is ultimately a set of Debian packages that exist as collections of files on the user's computer. Packages can be created and hosted by anyone willing and able to create a launchpad account and some skills with packaging. This section covers the details of Regolith's package structure and tips on creating your own.\n","excerpt":"Regolith, as a set of components, lacks a uniform configuration file, format, or set of conventions. …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/customize/","title":"Customize"},{"body":"Adding or Removing status indicators Finding Status Indicators $ apt search i3xrocks- Installing a Status Indicator $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-memory $ regolith-look refresh Customization of bar Each status indicator on the bar is managed by a file. The filename's sort order maps to the position of the status indicator on the bar. So for example, a file starting with 10_ will come before a file starting with 20_. Within each file contains some information that i3xrocks uses to execute a script that ultimately returns the data you see on the bar. Some of the status indicators have configuration parameters that can be adjusted to your liking. For example, if you would prefer that the battery status changes more readily, the polling interval can be updated. The first thing to do in order to customize the bar is to copy the indicators you wish to see from /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d to ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d. Once files have been added into ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d, i3xrocks will ignore the default files in /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d. Each file in ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d can be modified as you see fit. To change the order of status indicators on the bar, simply change the name of the files to the sort order you prefer.\nOnce you've made your changes, refreshing the session should cause the bar to update based on your new configuration.\nFor example, to change the order of the battery and net traffic blocks on the bar and not display notifications, perform the following steps:\n$ ls /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d 01_setup 30_net-traffic 80_battery 80_rofication 90_time $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d $ cd /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d $ cp 01_setup ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d/01_setup $ cp 80_battery ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d/30_battery $ cp 30_net-traffic ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d/80_net-traffic $ regolith-look refresh If any block configuration exists in the user directory ~/.config/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d, then the defaults in /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d will be ignored.\nFurther Reading See the reference page for configrations for more details about config files in Regolith.\n","excerpt":"Adding or Removing status indicators Finding Status Indicators $ apt search i3xrocks- Installing a …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/pt_br/docs/howto/add-remove-blocklets/","title":"Change Bar Status indicators"},{"body":"The following graph generated by debtree provides the dependency relationships of Regolith packages and some of their notable upstream dependencies:\nSource Packages Regolith's packages are hosted on PPAs provided by launchpad.net:\n   PPA Description Launchpad URL     ppa:regolith-linux/unstable Packages staged for developer testing. https://launchpad.net/~regolith-linux/+archive/ubuntu/unstable   ppa:regolith-linux/stable Packages that have been tested but have not been committed to a release. https://launchpad.net/~regolith-linux/+archive/ubuntu/stable   ppa:regolith-linux/release Packages as provided by the current Regolith release https://launchpad.net/~regolith-linux/+archive/ubuntu/release   ppa:kgilmer/speed-ricer General purpose packages that Regolith depends on that are not currently available via Ubuntu's repos. https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/speed-ricer    Git Repositories The source code associated with Regolith packages is hosted on Regolith Linux's GitHub organization.\nInstaller ISOs The installer is produced using the Cubic tool and providing the target ISO files as manual uploads to the Regolith Linux GitHub org.
